### Feb 28 – Visnu's Bachelor Party

Arrive early and join Visnu in Bangkok for his bachelor party. Remember to take
into account the time difference to get there in time. Jet lag will work for us
hopefully to stay up all night.

### Mar 1 – Sightseeing, shopping, relaxing

An unstructured day to explore Bangkok. We'd recommend getting a massage at
Healthland Spa; visiting the Royal Palace; taking a boat up the Chao Praya
River; getting a ride in a tuk-tuk; shopping at Siam Square / Paragon / MBK; or
eating some street food.

### Mar 2 – Thai Wedding

Do what you didn't do yesterday. Get a second massage. But be back by the
afternoon because we'll have a traditional Thai water ceremony followed by a
cocktail reception in the evening.

### Mar 3 – Depart for Phuket, Rehearsal Dinner

All we have to do is get everyone to Phuket this day. So, wake up early and eat
the included hotel breakfast and get moving to the airport. Once we get to
Phuket and settle in, we'll meet you again for more food.

### Mar 4 – Koh Phi Phi

We hope you packed lots of swimming suits because we're going snorkeling at one
of the most beautiful islands in the world. This one's on us and it should be
awesome.

### Mar 5 – Wedding Day!

Elephants! Beach wedding! Reception by the sea! Elephants! More surprises!

### Mar 6 – Recover / Depart

If you've got to go, we'll be sorry to see you leave. If you can, feel free to
hang out longer. We'll be staying around for a bit. You can rent a scooter and
putter about the island or just hang out at the beach all day.
