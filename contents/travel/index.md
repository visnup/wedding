Flights
-------

When booking travel yourself, we recommend [Hipmunk], [Kayak], [Orbitz], or
[Priceline]. Expect prices around $1,100 round-trip from SF. If you find a
great deal, feel free to share! For domestic travel, from Bangkok to Phuket,
check out [AirAsia] or [Bangkok Airways].

You'll want to be in Bangkok probably by Feb 28 and things will wrap up in
Phuket by Mar 6. Remember the time zone differences (you lose a whole day going
there). Feel free to stay longer on either end; we'll definitely be around.

Accommodations
--------------

### Bangkok (Feb 28 (or earlier) - March 3)

**We have a block of rooms with [Plaza Athénée]**. Rooms range from $160-$230
per night. **You can [book online now][book plaza athenee]**.

If you'd like to find a hotel yourself, there are many affordable bed &
breakfast options as well as AirBnB. We highly recommend finding one near BTS
(transit) and Sukhumvit (road/neighborhood).

Feel free to arrive as early as you wish but *we will be departing for Phuket
on March 3rd*.

### Phuket (March 3 - 6 (or later))

**We have a block of rooms available at the [Le Meridien Phuket]**, where we
will be staying and where the event will be held. Rates range are $194 per
night (book the [newly renovated deluxe pool view rooms][pool view room];
they're best). **Please [contact us](mailto:visnup@gmail.com) by Jan 20** to
book.

If you'd like other options, we recommend staying close by in the Karon region
of Phuket. Also, Patong Beach is a 15-20 minute car ride away and much livelier
beach and a for those looking for a more active time and hotels can be even
more affordable.
