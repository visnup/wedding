Flights
-------

Please contact Erica Hsu @ JJ Travel to book flights to Thailand and take
advantage of our group rate (about $1,000 roundtrip). If you wish to visit
other destinations on this trip, she can work to accommodate you. Please
reference: "Jane/Visnu - Thailand, March 2013." There's no real deadline, but
the sooner the better. Just contact her and provide her with your full name and
birth dates so she can at least lock you in on group pricing.

If you prefer to book travel yourself, we recommend Hipmunk, Kayak, Orbitz, or
Priceline. If you find a great deal, feel free to share! For domestic travel,
from Bangkok to Phuket, check out AirAsia or Bangkok Airways.

You'll want to be in Bangkok probably by Feb 28 and things will wrap up in
Phuket by Mar 6. Remember the time zone differences (you lose a whole day going
there). Feel free to stay longer on either end; we'll definitely be around.

Accommodations
--------------

### Bangkok

Dates: Feb 28 (or earlier) - March 3

We have a block of rooms with Plaza Athénée. Rooms range from $160-$230 per
night. You can book online now.

If you'd like to find a hotel yourself, there are many affordable bed &
breakfast options as well as AirBnB. We highly recommend finding one near BTS
(transit) and Sukhumvit (road/neighborhood).

Feel free to arrive as early as you wish but we will be departing for Phuket on
March 3rd.

### Phuket

Dates: March 3 - 6 (or later)

We have a block of rooms available at the Le Meridien Phuket, where we will be
staying and where the event will be held. Rates range are $194 per night (book
the newly renovated deluxe pool view rooms; they're best). You can book online
now.

If you'd like other options, we recommend staying close by in the Karon region
of Phuket. Also, Patong Beach is a 15-20 minute car ride away and much livelier
beach and a for those looking for a more active time and hotels can be even
more affordable.
