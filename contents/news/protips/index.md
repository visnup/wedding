Before going, some helpful tips:

- Read the [State Department's travel notices][1]. Some of it may come off as
  scary, but don't worry: Thailand isn't as bad as it makes it sound. It has
  lots of information you should probably know before going though.
- Read the [Wikitravel site for Bangkok][2] too. In particular, how to [avoid
  scams][3].
- If you can, take about $100 in Thai baht with you beforehand. Otherwise, at
  the money exchanger at the airport only take out a minimal amount ($50
  worth) and get the rest from the money exchange at a full-fledged bank in
  the city. Smaller money exchanges and hotels have higher rates. You can also
  get better rates for $100 bills. You can also use ATMs and get fair exchange
  rates, but you'll be charged an ATM fee + your bank will likely charge you
  for an international fee.
- Avoid the taxi scams at the airport: ignore all the people asking if you need
  a taxi as you walk out. Just follow signs to __Public Taxi__ [all the way
  outside on the curb][4]. You should find a desk and it shouldn't cost more
  than 300-400 baht ($10-$15). They should take credit card, but this is the
  reason you brought Thai cash if you're prepared.
