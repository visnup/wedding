We've arranged a deal for group airfare roundtrip to Thailand:

- SFO or LAX > Bangkok & Phuket > SFO or LAX = **$1145** 
- NYC > Bangkok & Phuket > NYC = **$1195**
- Cathay Pacific

If you're interested at all, **please send us your full name and birthdate on your passport**. Or, you can [fill out this form][2]. You can cancel at any time without penalty; we're just trying to lock in rates with Cathay Pacific.

Separately on AirAsia.com, you can book right now:

- Bangkok to Phuket = **$53**

This is one way (you'll only need one way if flying out of Phuket to home).

If you wish to make other stops in Asia, please contact our group travel agent [Erica @ JJ Travel][1] and she can accomodate you.
