### Plaza Athenee Bangkok

We're confirming soon with [Plaza Athenee][1] in Bangkok. Prices will range from THB 4,200 ($134) to THB 7,200 ($230) per night depending on how baller you want to be. We'll update here with details once we get booking info.

### Le Meridien

Go ahead and book rooms at Le Meridien and make sure they know you're with us. We have a [reservation form you can fax][3] from them, but are still working on a URL or online way to reserve. You can fax online for free using [hello fax][4] at least.

### Starwood

You'll notice we've gone all Starwood. If you've got rewards, get them. If not and you want yet another credit card, you might just want to check out the [Starwood AMEX][2]. There's an annual fee. But with 30,000 bonus points plus this trip, you'll have at least one damn nice hotel stay afterwards (then you can cancel it).
